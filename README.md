# HTML-and-CSS_Projects
 This repository contains all of my HTML and CSS Projects from my training in The Tech Academy Introduction course.
 
 <h2> Major Project List</h2>
 <h5>One-page Website</h5>
   In this particular project we were tasked with building a One-Page website. I chose to use my family as my motivation. There is a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS use shown. 
 <h5>HTML_CSS_Challenges</h5>
   This group of assignments was a list of individual challenges that were all built in the same HTML body and made to work in conjunction.
 <h5>bootstrap4_project</h5>
   This project was my first working with Bootstrap. There is basic HTML and CSS with bootstrap used here.
 <h5>Portfolio Assignment</h5>
   This was the final and most detailed project of the HTML and CSS course. I think that this is the most detailed of all of the projects in this repository.
 
 There are quite a few additional files and connected photos in this repository. These were all smaller challenges that I performed during this course.
