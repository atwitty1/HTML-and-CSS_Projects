<!--This section is about the paragraph below-->
<p>
	This paragraph is meant to demonstrate how to add a break point <br>
	As you can see this sentence is now on the next line down.<br>
	And this one too!!<br>
	Then I really wanted to make a <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">GREEN</span>word.
	I then wanted to write this line with an &nbsp extra space in the middle and a &#169 symbol.
